If you're only going to do one thing to improve your email marketing today, it's this: <mark>send every new subscriber a proper welcome email</mark>. Not an automated "Thanks for subscribing!" with your giant logo at the top, but something that acknowledges them as a person first, and customer second.

## Why care?

If you don't have a welcome email (or a welcome sequence) yet, you are leaving money on the table.

Email platforms make setting one up fairly easy—so there's no technical challenge here. What's important is that <mark>welcome emails get far better engagement than regular emails</mark>. According to [Invesp](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/welcome-emails/), they have an average of 4x more opens and 5x more clicks than regular email campaigns!

The real reason to care is simple: this is your one chance to tell people what they've signed up for before they forget about you (or worse, unsubscribe when you next reach out).

Picture this: Someone has just signed up. Maybe it's to receive your newsletter, or maybe they're trying out your software. Either way, they've taken a step towards your business. They've entered a real-life restaurant. If your website is the menu on the door and the "Hello, please come in", this email is the restaurant manager coming to personally welcome you and to walk you tbrough the culinary tranformation that you're about to experience.

## What goes in a welcome email? (The 5 must-haves)

A welcome email is your chance to offer a 10% discount to get customers tbrough the door. But it’s also an opportunity to connect with them and <mark>become the familiar face in a sea of indistinguishable brands</mark>.

You don't need to include much, but you do need these things:

<br>

**1. A subject line that isn't _Welcome!_** 

Try something that actually tells them what's inside. _Here's what to expect_ or _What you'll love about [brand/product name]_ work better already. Test it without any emoji first and only add one if it makes sense.

<br>

**2. Remind them who you are.** 

They might be reading this immediately after signing up. Or three weeks later. Refresh their memory.

<br>

**3. What are they're going to get from you?** 

If this a newsletter, how often will you email? What kind of stuff will you send? When's the next one? Answer these questions before they have to wonder.

<br>

**4. Give them something useful right now.** 

Don't make them wait for value. Share your best resource, a discount code if that's your strategy, or simply a link to something good that you've already released (e.g. your newest product or upcoming event).

<br>

**5. Offer an easy way out.** 

Make it simple to unsubscribe. It keeps your list healthy and stops people resenting you.

## Want replies? Do this

Ask them a question. 

Most people skip this and it's a big missed opportunity.

Justin Jackson, co-founder of Transistor.fm, does this both in the subject line AND the email body. He [sends new users a welcome email](https://justinjackson.ca/welcome-email) with this subject: 

<mark>What brought you here?</mark>

The email itself is short, introduces Jason, explains what Transistor does, and then asks:

<mark>I'm curious: what's happening in your world that brought you to Transistor?</mark>

He reports getting dozens of replies every week. And, I can assume, is not because he's being manipulative, but because he's genuinely asking and people can tell the difference.

The trick, if there's one, is making your question specific and easy to answer:

- _How can I help you?_ → Too vague.
- _What made you sign up today?_ → Better. 
- _What's the biggest challenge you're dealing with right now?_ → Works if that's actually relevant to what you're selling.
- _What's happening in your world that brought you to {us}?_ → If you want to copy Transistor nobody's stopping you.

People reply when the question you're asking feels like the start of a conversation rather a marketing email pretending not to be one.

## Single email or welcome sequence?

<mark>Sometimes sending one welcome email isn't enough</mark>. If you're onboarding people into your software, for example, you might need a series that walks them tbrough the setup over a few sages. Or if you're selling a course, you might want to drip content over time to keep them engaged.

What I tell my clients is that a welcome series makes a lot of sense when:

- There's genuine complexity to onboard (software, courses, memberships)
- You're guiding people tbrough a transformation that takes time
- You have a number of offers that you know your reader will find valuable, and you want to drip-share them over X many weeks.

It doesn't make sense when you're just padding out a signup process. One good email beats tbree mediocre ones. 

## The secret to a high-performing welcome email

[As Jimmy Kim so eloquently observed](https://x.com/yojimmykim/status/1902843002365591730), brands waste this moment by going straight to sending welcome sequences and they read like this:

- Email 1: Welcome to our brand!
- Email 2: Here's our story
- Email 3: Check out our products

Which roughly translates to: 

- We exist
- Let me talk about me
- Buy now?

If you have the power to decide, don't do this. It's insincere, reads like a press release, and the final sales pitch is as predictable as they come. Remember, <mark>email marketing is all about the long game</mark>. Not every email has to sell something; I know it's hard to come to terms with this.

Of course you want to give people the opportunity to buy from you, but this is your most important chance to start a relationship — in this case, with someone who has already told you they want to hear from you.

Instead, Kim recommends, keep the following tips in mind (they apply to both sequences and single welcome emails):

<mark>1. You're a person. Write like one</mark>. Write like you'd write to someone you're hoping to work with, not like you're addressing "valued customers."

<mark>2. Focus on transformation</mark>. Unless you're selling an autobiography, people didn't sign up to learn about your whole story. They signed up because they have a problem or goal. Help them with that immediately.

<mark>3. Ask something specific</mark>. If you're going to ask a question, make it narrow enough that they can answer in two sentences. Broad questions ("What are your goals?") will likely get ignored. 

<mark>4. Add a P.S. with something unexpected</mark>. A resource they wouldn't expect. A link to your favourite essay. Something that makes them think "huh, that's useful" rather than "this is obviously automated."

## Before you send it

Read it once more and ask: <mark>would I actually read this if it landed in my inbox from someone I just signed up with?</mark>

If the answer is "I'm not sure", send it to a trusted friend or colleague and ask for feedback.

If the answer's no, you're not done yet. 

Your welcome email sets expectations for everything that comes after, so it's worth getting right,. Even if that means rewriting it tbree times, which is normal, by the way.
