## About

This website closer resembles a big and rather imperfect Venn diagram rather than a portfolio site. You can expect to find a mix of things, including services I offer, events I run, and thing I'm working on. I update it as often as I can to reflect the flow of my current practice. There will probably be some design tweaks here and there as I update it.

## Technical {.light}

I built this website myself. Its code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/francescoimola/nevernotready.git). It's built with 11ty and deployed by Netlify. Early in the process, I forked its foundations from an 11ty template, although the current site and backend look nothing like the template.

The design was drafted directly on the webpage using VS Code. Pages are written either in Nunjucks or Markdown. I do not currently collect user analytics data, although this might change. My domain francescoimola.com is registered with Hover.

This website was previously two websites, I used to have a container for everything business-related, and one for everything else. I have since recognised the value of my multidisciplnary practice and have redesigned this site to accomodate more of what I do and have to share.

## AI use {.light}

This site was created and is maintained by a single person. To improve the reliability of code, fix bugs, and edit text, I occasionally use Claude by Anthropic (and more rarely ChatGPT by OpenAI). AI tools came into the picture when I rebuilt this site in 2025 because professional editing or development support wasn’t financially possible. That said, all final decisions remain human-made, i.e. mine.

I'm aware how the use of LLMs carries a carbon footprint. While this site’s code is efficient and powered by renewable energy, I acknowledge that such measures won't erase the environmental cost of using AI in the first place.

## Analytics and tracking {.light}

Trying to browse the internet without having to hand over your personal data is pretty much impossible these days. Most businesses see the £0 price tag Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel come with and don't blink once before setting it up. Yet they don't realise it takes a lot of infrastructure and energy to track and store data. Some don't think about how they collect, use and share their customers' data in the first place. Which explains why unethical, resource-hungry tracking scripts have become so pervasive.

As an industry, we marketers, designers and developers need to rethink priorities to put people, privacy and the planet first. If we can cut down on the number of tracking scripts we use on our websites, we can be more responsible about these things.

Personally, consumer trust is as important as the services I deliver. Which is why I've done absolutely everything to avoid using tracking scripts. The only data-gathering script that's active on this website is from [Ahrefs Web Analytics](https://ahrefs.com/web-analytics), which helps me track technical SEO and site health. It's lightweight (2KB), cookie-free, and it DOES NOT collect personal data because it just aggregates behaviour without identifying users.

## Typography in use {.light}

[Ronzino by Collletttivo](https://www.collletttivo.it/typefaces/ronzino) is all over this website.

A new open-source spin on the cult-classic Arial, Ronzino improves on Arial's many drawbacks while retaining a similar information-driven feeling and staying nondescript. Collletttivo is a team of Italian designers. I felt it important to pay homage to my home country through typography, the very fabric ingredient of any website, especially this.
