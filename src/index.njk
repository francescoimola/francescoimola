	<h2>Where I can help</h2>
	<p>Marketers and designers can make their work sound very mysterious. I like to keep it simple: I help you design
		systems that don't eat your life. The kind that run while you sleep, age like good wine and
		never ask you to dance for an algorithm. It's the marketing that lets you get on with it.</p>

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I'm a designer at heart, although you can often find me building bridges across the murky waters of marketing,
		art, and creating resources for the public good.</p>
	<p>I've previously worked with teams from <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/las/design" target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">University of Greenwich</a>, <a href="https://www.seatingplan.com/" target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">Mega Seating Plan</a>, and <a href="https://blueberrycreatives.co.uk/" target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">Blueberry</a>, in both B2B and B2C environments. In this lifetime, I've also been a music
		producer, exhibition curator, visual artist, social media manager, photographer, runner, barista, and <a
			href="/playground">many other things</a>.</p>
	<p>These days, I partner with people who want to do good and do it well. I help them solve problems, usually
		connected with their website, digital operations, or inbound marketing strategy. </p>
	<p>Mind you, I'm no specialist. But where specialists see websites, emails, marketing strategy and operations as separate problems, I can see the
		whole mess because I'm not stuck in one corner and I can help you untangle it.

	<h2>Planet-aware design</h2>
	<p>My mission is to do "good" creative work, but this is only achievable by rethinking what is important: putting people and the planet first.</p>
	<p>While my work is far from perfect, I use every project as an opportunity to shape the change I want to see in the world
		as I bring valuable ideas, solutions and enthusiasm to the table. That said, I refuse to work with big
		polluters and I don't partner with fossil fuel clients or those who are directly associated with the
		fossil fuel industry.</p>

	<h2>Where I work</h2>
	<p>I operate globally on a GMT timezone, but I especially love working with people and teams in Folkestone, Kent, the South
		East, and London.</p>
	<p>My work is primarily web design and email marketing for small businesses and creatives who've outgrown
		the DIY approach, but when it comes to local opportunities, I'm also open to step into creative direction, SEO, or curatorial roles—if there's a particular
		connection to the work.</p>
	<p>If you're a local business or individual and you're looking a fresh perspective and someone you can also talk to IRL, I've been waiting especially for you.</p>
