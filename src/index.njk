	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Although I'm a designer at heart, you can often find me building bridges across the murky waters of marketing, branding,
		art, and building resources for fellow creatives.</p>
	<p>I've previously worked with B2B, B2C, and public-sector teams from <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/las/design" target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Greenwich</a>, <a href="https://www.seatingplan.com/" target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Mega Seating Plan</a>, and <a href="https://blueberrycreatives.co.uk/" target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Blueberry</a>. In this lifetime, I've also dipped my toes in <a
			href="/playground/">other creative disciplines</a>, including music production, exhibition curation, visual art, social media content, and photography.
	<p>I now partner with people who care deeply about what they do, and I help them solve problems with their website, mailing list, SEO, or marketing operations. My superpower? I'm no specialist. The beauty of not being stuck in one corner is that, unlike specialists, 1) I don't wear blinders, 2) I can see the big picture, and 3) I can get you out of (almost) any quandary.</p>

</section>

<section class="pad-btt-md cap-width ">
	<h2>Planet-aware design</h2>
	<p>My mission is to do "good" creative work, but this is only achievable by rethinking what is important: putting people and the planet first.</p>
	<p>While my work is far from perfect, I use every project as an opportunity to shape the change I want to see in the world
		as I bring valuable ideas, solutions and enthusiasm to the table. That said, I refuse to work with big
		polluters and I don't partner with fossil fuel clients or those who are directly associated with the
		fossil fuel industry.</p>

	<h2>Where I work</h2>
	<p>I operate globally on a GMT timezone, but I especially love working with people and teams in Folkestone, Kent, the South
		East, and London.</p>
	<p>While my work is primarily web design and email marketing for small businesses and creatives who've outgrown
		the DIY approach, when it comes to local opportunities, I'm also open to step into creative direction, SEO, or curatorial roles—providing there's a strong
		connection to the work.</p>
	<p>If you're a local business or individual and you're looking a fresh perspective and someone you can also talk to IRL, I've been waiting especially for you.</p>
